# Dead code

Code is **dead** when it can be **proven** to have no effect on the program's behaviour. repogarde distinguishes three cases, which are not proven the same way:

| Category | Definition | Examples | Proof | repogarde |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Unreachable** | statements no execution path can reach | code after a `return`, `if (false)` | control-flow analysis | **proven**: blocking |
| **Unused in its scope** | declaration never referenced where it is visible | import, local variable, **private** parameter or member never read | file reference analysis | **proven**: blocking |
| **Unreferenced in the project** | externally visible element that nothing in the project uses | public method, export, file, dependency | call graph from the entry points | **candidate**: warning |

The first two cases are certain: the tool guesses nothing. The third one is not always, because code can be called **without a visible reference**:

- reflection and injection (Spring beans, `Class.forName`, `getattr`);
- calls from outside: a library's public API, HTTP routes, scheduled jobs;
- serialization (Jackson, JPA), templates, configuration, another language.

That is why a **candidate** never blocks by default: a human confirms.

## Only new dead code

repogarde only reports dead code **introduced** by the PR (lines added or changed since the base). An existing project is not flooded with its history: the debt stops growing, and you reduce it at your own pace.

## Tools, by language

| Language | Proven | Candidates |
|---|---|---|
| Java (Maven, Gradle) | PMD: unused imports, private fields, methods and variables | — (Spring and reflection make the analysis too uncertain) |
| TypeScript / JavaScript | `tsc`: unused variables, parameters, imports, unreachable code | [knip](https://knip.dev) if installed in the project: files, exports, dependencies |
| Python | ruff (F401, F811, F841), vulture at 100% confidence | vulture below 100% (the percentage is shown) |
| Go | staticcheck (U1000: unused unexported identifiers) | — |

In CI, the action installs PMD for a Java project (pinned version and checksum). Other tools are the project's own. A missing tool is reported without failing, even in strict mode: detection remains an aid.

## Usage

- **CI**: the `deadcode` check, included by default in the action (`checks:`).
- **Developer machine**: `bin/code-mort [base]` analyses your branch like the CI: commits, pending changes and new files.

## Settings

```ini
[repogarde]
    deadcode = block               # default: proven blocks, candidates warn
    # deadcode = warn              # nothing blocks
    # deadcode = strict            # candidates block too
    deadcodeIgnore = src/generated/* legacy/*   # ignored paths
    # skip = deadcode              # disable the check
```

A one-off false positive can also be declared with the tool's annotation (`@SuppressWarnings("PMD.UnusedPrivateMethod")`, `# noqa: F401`, `// @ts-expect-error`…), visible in review.
